# TASK 3.

Congratulations! You made it this far.

To complete task 3, you need to deploy an application(It would be better if you deployed a 3 tier application). 
This application can be built with any programming language of your choice. (You can fork any sample project on github and proceed to deploy)

This application should be deployed on your linux server.

You can also decide to spice it up a bit, and point it to a domain via a free or paid DNS provider(yourchoice), whichever way you want, 
but the goal is that you deploy your application successfully 

I'm eager to see how you do on this!
